        <h2>My Biography!</h2>
      </head>

      <body>
        <p>
          I was born and raised in Spokane, Washington. I have lived here ever
          since I was born, but I hope to one day travel and visit many other
          cities. My parents are both from Vietnam, so I wish to one day visit
          the motherland. I started off as a Psychology major, but found myself
          really enjoying marketing. Fun fact: I am still best friends with 3
          other girls from my middle school!
        </p>

        <p>
          I have two younger siblings: my brother is a sophmore here at Gu, and
          my sister is in 8th grade at a local middle school. We have never
          owned pets, but I would like to own a cat someday! I am really close
          with my siblings; we feed a lot into each other, so my siblings and I
          share a lot of common interests and hobbies. While we have similar
          hobbies, we have all found our own path in life.
        </p>

        I feel like I am a well-rounded individual with many different hobbies
        that range from a variety of interests, which include:
          <ol>
          <li>Video Games</li>
          <ul>
            <li>PC Games i.e. Stardew Valley</li>
            <li>Handhold Games i.e. Pokemon and Mario Kart</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Sports</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Volleyball</li>
            <li>Pickleball</li>
            <li>Track and Field</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Cooking and Baking</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Asian</li>
            <li>American</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Collecting</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Enamel Pins</li>
            <li>Stickers</li>
            <li>Smiskis and Mofusand</li>
            <ul>
          </ol>

          <h2>Future Aspirations</h2>
        </head>
        <body>
          My first year at Gonzaga, I had wanted to become a school counselor,
          since then, I have moved from wanting to become a psychologist, math
          teacher, and now a marketing analyist! Something interesting about me
          is that I am a pretty fickle person, good or bad, it makes me an
          aspirational person; I might be an analyist in the future, but I could
          change my mind again.
          <p>
            If possible, I would love a job that is flexible in nature and in
            work schedule. I thrive off of the ability of changing up my
            schedule to do spontaneous things, and I love going into work not
            quite knowing what I will be doing that day. I hope to have a job
            where I have my own office/cubicle to decorate and to have my own
            space, but be able to go out and converse with my coworkers. After
            being in social work, I hope to do something that will genuinely
            help others. I want to do something that is environmentally safe, is
            self-fulfilling, and feels less like work, and more like a hobby. <br>

            can be something that helps one to grow and feel a sense of
            fulfillment--I hope one day more people will social work as I do!

              I really enjoy getting involved in a variety of clubs and off-campus groups.
              Participating in social events and groups that are not part of my day-to-day life
              help me to break the monotony and to prevent burnout. These are just some things I do
              to help me stay motivated and feel like an involved community member!
